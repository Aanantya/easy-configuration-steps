        NGINX LINUX SETUP - NOTE 1

Nginx.conf 

1. visit nginx installation folder and 'ls' into the folder

    $ cd /etc/nginx
    $ la -ah


2. To view nginx user
    
    $ cat /etc/passwd

    * Check at the botton

3. To check how nginx process is running
    
    $ pa aux |grep nginx

4. Worker_processes (More Worker_processes..better performance but,
    too many Worker_processes many lead to performance defficency)

    * Currently, worker_processes = auto;

5. Nginx logs

    $ ls -l /var/log/nginx

    * access.log : shows up when nginx is up and running

            $ tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log


    * error.log


6. pid ( Shows where pid file for nginx is located)

7. events --> worker_connections ( Total number of connections a work may have )


8. http [block] ( Configuring web server )

9. conf.d/default.conf (default server Configuration i.e server [block])

    * error_page ( errors it handles) 
        * errors are send to /50x.html
    
    * root webpage location as '/root'

    * server_name as domain server_name


    if multiple websites exits then multiple location / [block] will be created

        for eg. location /bolg/ {
                root ...;
                index ...;
            }


    * file is case sensitive

    Example for server mapping : 
        www.domain_name/ --> /user/share/nginx/html/index.html

10. To restart nginx and remove all the changes made

    $ systemctl restart nginx
    $ systemctl status nginx

    else

    $ systemctl reload nginx
    $ systemctl status nginx
